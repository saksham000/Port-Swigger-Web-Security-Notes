🔐 How to Prevent Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities
Information disclosure can happen in many ways, so you can't block every possible leak with just one fix. But here are best practices you should always follow:

✅ 1. Know What Is Sensitive
Make sure your whole team understands what counts as sensitive:

📧 Emails, phone numbers, usernames

🔑 API keys, tokens, session IDs

🧠 Internal logic, server file paths

🛠️ Framework versions, database errors

🧠 Example: A simple message like
"User admin123 not found"
seems harmless — but helps attackers enumerate users.

✅ 2. Audit Code for Leaks
As part of your code reviews or CI/CD pipelines, check for:

👨‍💻 Developer comments like <!-- admin panel here -->

🔑 Hardcoded credentials in files

🗂 Leftover backup files or test scripts

✅ You can use automated tools to scan and remove these.

✅ 3. Use Generic Error Messages
Don’t give away internal logic in errors.

❌ Bad:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Error: SQL syntax near 'DROP TABLE users;'
✅ Good:

cpp
Copy
Edit
Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again.
Why? Because detailed errors help attackers craft payloads.

✅ 4. Disable Debugging in Production
Debug tools can expose:

📂 File paths

🔑 Secrets

🧪 App internals

Double-check that things like:

DEBUG=true

Verbose logging

/debug endpoints

…are turned off when your app is live.

✅ 5. Secure Third-Party Tools Properly
Frameworks, CMSs, libraries (like Laravel, Django, WordPress) often come with:

Default credentials

Debugging modes

Verbose error handlers

🔍 Learn how to configure them securely. Disable what you don’t use.
