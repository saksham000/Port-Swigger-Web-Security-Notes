🔍 What is Information Disclosure?
Information Disclosure (or Information Leakage) happens when a website accidentally shares sensitive data with users or attackers.

This can include:

👤 Other users' info (like usernames or bank details)

🏢 Company secrets (like product plans or pricing strategies)

🧱 Technical details (like server info, database names, etc.)

Even if it's just technical info, attackers can use that to plan bigger attacks later.

💥 Why Is It Dangerous?
If a website shows an error message with database names, an attacker may use that to launch SQL Injection.

If you accidentally publish a backup file (like index.php.bak), attackers may download the entire source code.

If your site shows different messages when logging in with a wrong username vs. a wrong password, an attacker can guess which usernames are real.

🧪 Examples of Information Disclosure:
Example	What attacker learns
robots.txt shows hidden folders	Where sensitive files are stored
Error message: Unknown column 'credit_card'	Database has a credit_card column
Exposed .git folder	Entire website code history
Comment in HTML: <!-- TODO: disable admin login -->	Developer forgot to remove something important

🧠 How These Issues Happen
Forgetting to remove development data
Example: Leaving <!-- secret API key here --> in HTML.

Bad configuration
Example: Debug mode shows full error trace including server files.

Application design flaws
Example: Login form says "user not found" or "wrong password" — this helps attackers guess usernames.

📉 Impact of These Vulnerabilities
Direct impact: If credit card info leaks, it’s very serious.

Indirect impact: Knowing a site uses PHP 5.6 (outdated) could let attackers find a public exploit.

So, how bad it is depends on what an attacker can do with the leaked info.

🧪 How to Test and Rate the Risk
Don’t panic over every small detail. If you find technical info like the framework used (e.g., Laravel), ask:
❓“Is it an old version with known bugs?”

If you can’t abuse the info, it may not be critical.

If you can use it to attack, it becomes high severity.

✅ How to Prevent Information Disclosure
❌ Don’t show full error messages to users

🔐 Don’t hardcode secrets (API keys, DB passwords)

🚫 Disable debug/verbose logging in production

🧹 Remove development files, backups, and hidden folders
