🔐 What is Path Traversal?
Definition (Simple):
Path traversal (also called directory traversal) is a type of hacking trick where an attacker tries to access files they shouldn't be allowed to see on a web server.

📂 Imagine This Example:
You're on a shopping website, and it shows product images like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
When you see a shoe on the website, it loads the image from a folder on the server:

📁 /var/www/images/218.png

Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes:

The server takes whatever filename you give it and adds it to a folder path.

Example: if you say filename=218.png, it loads /var/www/images/218.png

⚠️ Where It Goes Wrong (Path Traversal Attack)
If the server doesn't check the filename properly, a hacker can abuse it.

💀 Example of Attack:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
What does this mean?

.. means “go up one folder”

../../../ means “go up 3 folders”

So instead of reading from /var/www/images/218.png, it goes:

swift
Copy
Edit
/var/www/images/ → (..)
   → /var/www/ → (..)
      → /var/ → (..)
         → /etc/passwd
And now the attacker sees the file /etc/passwd, which is a sensitive file on Unix/Linux servers (it lists system users).

🪟 Windows Example
Windows uses backslashes \ instead of slashes /.

So a hacker might use:

Copy
Edit
..\..\..\windows\win.ini
This also steps up folders and tries to read something like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Windows\win.ini
🛡️ What Can Go Wrong?
If successful, the attacker might:

See passwords

Read source code

Find secret files

Or even write files to the server and take over it!


Lab Process

Simplely open a image to new tab and
in url in filename= add this ../../../etc/passwd
and BOOM ! Solved.
