Basically in this lab insted of normal way what server filter do is

it looks for ../ in user input and removes it but do not do this recursively.

so do everything 2 times so that it removes first and we left with our orignal payload like this
../../../etc/passwd insted of this do this
....//....//....//etc/passwd so it removes first ../ and left the orignal payload at the end.
