üï∂Ô∏è What is Blind OS Command Injection?
Blind OS Command Injection is when your command does get executed on the server, but‚Ä¶

‚ùå You don‚Äôt see the result of that command in the website's response.

It‚Äôs like texting someone a question and they do what you asked, but never reply back ‚Äî so you don't know for sure what happened.

üß™ Example Scenario
Let‚Äôs say there's a feedback form on a website:

You type your email and a message like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Email: peter@normal-user.net  
Message: This site is great!
The backend uses a Linux command to send this feedback via email:

nginx
Copy
Edit
mail -s "This site is great" -aFrom:peter@normal-user.net feedback@vulnerable-website.com
You don't see the result of the mail command ‚Äî so you can‚Äôt use something like echo hello to test for injection (because the echoed "hello" won't appear in the browser).

‚è±Ô∏è How to Detect Blind Command Injection?
Even if you can‚Äôt see the output, you can still detect if your command is running ‚Äî by checking if the server takes longer to respond.

‚úÖ Trick: Use Time Delays
Inject this in the email field:

css
Copy
Edit
peter@normal-user.net & ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
This full command becomes:

nginx
Copy
Edit
mail -s "This site is great" -aFrom:peter@normal-user.net & ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 & feedback@vulnerable-website.com
Here's what happens:

mail starts

ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 pings itself (localhost) 10 times = ~10 seconds delay

Server waits for ping to finish before responding

‚úÖ If you notice the feedback form takes way longer than usual (like 10+ seconds), it‚Äôs a strong clue that the ping command was executed ‚Äî which proves a blind OS command injection exists.

LAB PROCESS

use this command to exploit the vulnerability
csrf=T3EcKa16c9tPL9jnnywDEBWmVWyRnmxy&name=hi&email=sax%40gmail.com& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 & &subject=xxx&message=hello

ONLY EMAIL FIELD IS vulnerabile.

add this to gmail section & ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 & and encode this and send it and BOOM ! solved the lab.

instead of this we can also use  & sleep 10# and url encode this and this also works.
