Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output
You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using the browser. For example, if the application serves static resources from the filesystem location /var/www/static, then you can submit the following input:

& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &
The > character sends the output from the whoami command to the specified file. You can then use the browser to fetch https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt to retrieve the file, and view the output from the injected command.


LAB PROCESS

use this payload to exploit
 & whoami > /var/www/images/res.txt & sleep 10 & #
 add this in email section and do url encodeing and after that go to any image open it to new tab and in place of filename just enter res.txt and BOOM ! solved the lab.
