🛡️ How to Prevent OS Command Injection
The best solution is:

❌ Don’t use system commands at all with user input.

Instead, use safe platform APIs.

✅ If you must use system commands:
Validate input strictly:

Allow only known safe values (whitelist)

Example: Only accept storeID=101, 102, 103

Allow only numbers if numeric input is expected

Only allow letters and numbers, no special characters

🚫 Never do this:
Don’t just try to "sanitize" input by escaping characters (\, quotes, etc.) — it's too easy to mess up and attackers can bypass it.
