🔐 What Is Authentication?
Authentication means checking who you are.

Think of it like showing your ID before entering a building. The website wants to know if you are really you.

🔑 3 Main Types of Authentication:
Something You Know

Example: Password, PIN, answer to a security question

Called a "knowledge factor"

Something You Have

Example: Your phone, a security token (like an OTP app or YubiKey)

Called a "possession factor"

Something You Are or Do

Example: Fingerprint, face scan, typing style

Called an "inherence factor"

Websites can use one, two, or all three for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

🧾 Authentication vs Authorization (Very Important!)
Authentication = Who are you?

Example: You log in with your username and password.

Authorization = What are you allowed to do?

Example: After logging in, can you view your own profile? Or edit someone else’s?

📌 Think of it like this:
🔓 Authentication opens the door.
🛑 Authorization tells you which rooms you can enter.

⚠️ How Do Authentication Vulnerabilities Happen?
Two common ways:

Weak Defenses Against Brute-Force Attacks

If a website lets someone try passwords over and over (without blocking or rate-limiting), attackers can guess passwords easily.

Broken Logic / Poor Coding

Example: The website lets you skip login if you visit a certain URL.

This is called broken authentication — and it’s a big risk.

💣 What’s the Risk?
Small Issue? ❌ Nope. Authentication bugs are usually very serious because:
Hackers can log in as other users.

If they log in as admin, they can:

Control the whole site

Steal all the data

Access the server or internal systems

Even low-level user accounts can help hackers:

Access hidden pages

Collect private data

Launch deeper attacks

🔐 So, a small crack in login security can turn into a huge breach.
