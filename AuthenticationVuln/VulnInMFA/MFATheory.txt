🔐 What Is Multi-Factor Authentication?
MFA means a user must prove their identity in more than one way, like:

Something you know → Password

Something you have → Mobile phone with code

(Sometimes) Something you are → Fingerprint, face scan, etc.

Example of 2FA:
Step 1: You enter your password

Step 2: You enter a 6-digit code from your mobile app (like Google Authenticator)

✅ This is much safer than just a password.

❌ But MFA Can Still Be Vulnerable
Just like passwords, MFA can be hacked — if it’s badly implemented.

⚠️ Weakness #1: Not True 2FA (Fake MFA)
Sometimes a site claims to use 2FA, but it’s really just verifying the same factor twice.

🧾 Example: Email-based 2FA

Step 1: Enter password

Step 2: Enter code sent to your email

But your email account also uses just a password — so both steps rely on the same knowledge (your password).

📌 So if someone steals your password, they can also log into your email — and get the code.

❗ True 2FA = Two different factors (e.g., password + device)

⚠️ Weakness #2: SMS Codes Are Risky
Some websites send codes via SMS text messages.

That’s "something you have" — your phone. But:

SMS can be intercepted

Hackers can use SIM swapping to take over your number

They call the phone company, pretend to be you, and transfer your number to their SIM card

➡️ Now they receive the 2FA codes meant for you 😬

⚠️ Weakness #3: Bad Implementation = Total Bypass
Sometimes 2FA is only partially enforced.

🧪 Example Attack:

Website has:

Login page → asks for username & password

Then redirects to 2FA page for code

But what if the system already considers you logged in after step 1?

🧨 A hacker can try skipping the 2FA step and directly open a protected page:

https://example.com/account
If that page loads without checking 2FA, the second step is useless!
