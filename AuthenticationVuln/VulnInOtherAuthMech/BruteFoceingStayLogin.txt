🔓 Authentication Isn’t Just the Login Page
Most websites focus on securing the login form, but attackers also target other features like:

🔑 Password reset

🛠️ Account recovery

🧾 "Remember me" (keep me logged in)

These parts are often overlooked — but if they’re poorly implemented, attackers can use them to bypass login security.

🧠 Case 1: “Remember Me” = Big Risk if Not Done Right
Websites often offer:

✅ [x] Keep me logged in

This stores a "remember me" token in your browser as a cookie, so you stay logged in next time.

🔥 What Could Go Wrong?
If the token is predictable, an attacker can guess it and log in as the victim — without needing a password.

🔓 Bad Implementation Example:
Imagine the cookie looks like:

ini
Copy
Edit
remember=Base64(username:timestamp)
Or worse:

ini
Copy
Edit
remember=Base64(username:password)
If an attacker:

Creates their own account

Logs in and gets their cookie

Decodes it and sees: john:1690000000

They might guess that the format is:

ini
Copy
Edit
remember = Base64(username + ":" + timestamp)
➡️ They can now try to generate tokens for other users, brute-force them, and gain access.

🔐 Even Encrypted Cookies Can Be Weak
Developers might try to "encrypt" the cookie to hide its values — but:

🔁 Base64 is NOT encryption, just encoding — anyone can decode it

🔐 Even real encryption (like SHA-1, SHA-256) isn’t safe if:

No random salt is added

The hashing algorithm is known

The attacker can just hash a wordlist until they get a match

🧪 Real-World Attack:
Attacker creates their account, sees the hash for: attacker:1234

They hash combinations like victim:1234, victim:1235, etc.

Eventually, they find a cookie that lets them log in as victim


Lab Process

Stay logged in cookie is Base64 Encoded
The Passwoed is MD5 Hashed use crackstation to check

now encode all passwords to MD5
then encode the string to Base64
and bruteforce
Base64(username:passwordMD5)

to do all this automatically
in intruder in payload processing tab
do this 
add hash of MD5
add prefix carlos:
add encodeing as Base64
