In this lab we can enumrate throught usernames without any problem but
the goal is to find the valid username first soo first

in intrduer set usernames for 1 and password is null payload make it 5 times concat this null with a string
use custer bomb and got the username = guest

THE MAIN LOGIC VULN IS HERE IS
In backend if i try right username and wrong password too many times
my account got locked for 1 min but during that lock if i enter right password
in response it does not show any error like inavlid username or password

and Boom check the password which does not show any error that it.
we can see diffrence in response recived.

the password is = pass
