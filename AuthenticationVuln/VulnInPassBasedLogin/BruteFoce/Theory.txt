🔐 Password-Based Login Vulnerabilities
When websites use usernames + passwords for login, they’re trusting that only the real user knows the correct password.

But if an attacker guesses or steals those details, they can log in as the user. That’s a major risk.

🚨 Common Attack: Brute-Force
A brute-force attack is when a hacker tries tons of username-password combinations until one works.

🔧 They use automated tools with big wordlists like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
usernames: admin, john, alice123
passwords: 123456, password, Welcome123!
They don’t type these manually — tools can try hundreds of logins per second.

💡 Smarter Brute-Force: Not Just Random Guessing
Hackers don’t just try random stuff. They use patterns:

Companies often use firstname.lastname@company.com

Admin accounts are often named admin, administrator, or it_support

Users choose predictable passwords like Mypassword1!

📌 So brute-force becomes faster and more accurate when attackers use logic and patterns.

🎯 Brute-Forcing Usernames
Usernames are often easy to guess because:

Many websites use email as username

Admin usernames are common and reused

Sometimes usernames are exposed on public pages

🔍 Example:
A company website shows user profiles like:
https://site.com/users/john.doe

Even if the profile is hidden, the username is likely john.doe

🔓 Brute-Forcing Passwords
Even if strong passwords are required, users often:

Use easy variations of common passwords:

Mypassword1!, Myp@ssw0rd, Password2024!

Slightly change passwords over time:

Mypassword1! → Mypassword2! → Mypassword3!

🧠 Hackers know this. So they design their tools to try common human patterns, not just random gibberish.

🎭 Username Enumeration (Silent Clue Leaks)
Username enumeration means a hacker can tell whether a username is real — just by how the website reacts.

🧪 Examples:
Status Codes:

Invalid user: 401 Unauthorized

Valid user, wrong password: 403 Forbidden

🔥 Clue! The attacker now knows the username is valid.

Error Messages:

"User does not exist" vs. "Incorrect password"

🔥 Even a small difference helps the attacker.

Response Time Differences:

Valid username: Site checks password → takes longer

Invalid username: Fails immediately → quicker

Hackers use tools to measure this timing!

✅ What Should Websites Do?
Use the same error message for all login failures.
e.g. "Invalid username or password."

Make sure status codes don’t give hints.

Use rate-limiting and lockouts after multiple failed attempts.

Implement 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for extra safety.
