🛡️ How to Prevent Business Logic Vulnerabilities
Business logic flaws are mistakes in how the app is supposed to work, not just bugs in code.
So, to prevent them, you need to focus on both understanding the app and writing logic carefully.

✅ 1. Understand the Business Domain
💡 If you don’t understand what the app is supposed to do, you can’t secure it.

Know what normal user behavior looks like.

Understand what should and should not be allowed.

Developers and testers must be familiar with the business rules (like: "Discounts only apply on final cart total", "Only managers can approve refunds", etc.).

📌 Example: In an e-commerce app, testers must know that discounts should recalculate when items are removed from the cart — not just apply once.

✅ 2. Don’t Assume Users Behave Normally
❌ Don’t assume users won’t tamper with things.

Users might skip steps, change data, or replay requests.

Use tools like Burp Suite to test abnormal behaviors (remove fields, change values, repeat actions).

📌 Example: A user might skip payment but still place an order by manually crafting the request.

✅ 3. Validate Everything on the Server
Never trust user input, even if the browser seems to enforce rules.

Validate:

Input types and value ranges

Business logic rules (e.g. stock availability, user permissions)

📌 Example: Don’t just check “amount > 0” — also check that “user owns this account” before processing a transfer.

✅ 4. Maintain Clear Documentation
Keep records of:

Assumptions (e.g. “Discount must apply only once”)

Data flow (how data moves between components)

Dependencies (if one component affects another)

📌 Example: If a cart module depends on the inventory module, document how they interact — attackers might exploit weak links.

✅ 5. Write Clear, Understandable Code
🧠 If code is messy or confusing, logic flaws will be missed.

Use meaningful variable names

Keep logic separated into functions

Use comments only when logic is non-obvious
