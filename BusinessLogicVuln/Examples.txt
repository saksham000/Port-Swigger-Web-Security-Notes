🔎 What Are These Examples About?
Business logic vulnerabilities usually happen when developers make incorrect assumptions about how users behave or how their app is used.

While the actual bugs may differ from app to app, many share the same root mistakes.

Let’s now look at realistic types of mistakes and what kind of logic flaws they create 👇

✅ 1. Trusting Client-Side Validation
❌ Mistake:
Assuming that checks done in the browser (JavaScript) will always protect the app.

🧪 Exploit Example:
A user tries to change their account balance. The webpage says “You can only deposit ₹1000 max,” but this limit is enforced only by JavaScript.

A hacker disables JavaScript or uses Burp Suite to send a request with ₹10,000.

🎯 Impact:
Bypasses the limit and deposits a huge amount, possibly affecting calculations, bonuses, or rewards.

✅ 2. Skipping Important Steps in a Workflow
❌ Mistake:
Assuming users will go through a fixed flow (e.g., add to cart → pay → confirm).

🧪 Exploit Example:
An attacker skips the "payment" step and directly accesses the "order confirmation" URL using intercepted requests.

🎯 Impact:
They get the product or service without paying.

✅ 3. Insecure Use of Coupons or Discounts
❌ Mistake:
Assuming coupons can only be used once or are restricted properly.

🧪 Exploit Example:
User applies a ₹500 discount coupon and it works. But there is no backend check to prevent them from using it again.

They repeat the request and keep applying the discount.

🎯 Impact:
Unlimited free products or massive loss to the business.

✅ 4. Incomplete Authorization Checks
❌ Mistake:
Only checking if someone is logged in — not checking their role or identity.

🧪 Exploit Example:
An attacker changes a request like:

sql
Copy
Edit
GET /api/orders/view?userId=123
to

sql
Copy
Edit
GET /api/orders/view?userId=999
No check is done to confirm they own order 999.

🎯 Impact:
User accesses other people's data (privacy breach).

✅ 5. Lack of Rate Limiting or Abuse Prevention
❌ Mistake:
Assuming users will use the app at normal speed (e.g., login attempts, purchase requests).

🧪 Exploit Example:
A user sends 1,000 purchase requests per second to grab all items during a flash sale.

🎯 Impact:
Other users miss out. Unfair advantage or DoS attack.

✅ 6. Misusing Numeric or Boolean Logic
❌ Mistake:
Relying on insecure or simple flags to determine access or state.

🧪 Exploit Example:
User profile has:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
isAdmin: false
in JSON request. Hacker changes it to:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
isAdmin: true
And the server accepts it without checking.

🎯 Impact:
Regular user becomes admin.

✅ 7. Failing to Handle Unusual Input or Edge Cases
❌ Mistake:
Not thinking about unexpected input, like negative numbers, zero, or huge values.

🧪 Exploit Example:
A return form accepts quantity = -1.

Hacker submits:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Refund for -1 items = +₹100
Instead of charging, the system gives money.

🎯 Impact:
Fraud, financial loss.
