🧠 What Does It Mean?
Many developers assume users will:

Follow the normal flow of the application.

Never try to break rules or tamper with anything.

Stay trustworthy forever once verified.

👉 These assumptions are wrong and can lead to logic flaws that attackers can exploit.

🚨 Example 1: “Once a user is verified, they’ll stay honest”
Let’s say your app verifies that a new user:

Uploads valid documents

Passes verification

Then gets a “trusted” user status

❌ Flawed Assumption:
"Now that this user is verified, we don’t need to check them again."

🧪 What an attacker can do:
Once marked as “trusted”, the attacker:

Changes their profile info

Adds fake data

Exploits the system using privileges they now have

🔚 Impact: Loopholes are created where initial checks are bypassed in later stages.

🔒 Security Checks Must Be Applied Consistently
It’s a big mistake to check things only once at login or registration and never again.

🧪 Example:
You check that a user is not banned during login.

But after login, you let them perform actions without checking if they’re banned again.

The user gets banned, but can still use the system if the post-login logic doesn't re-check.

🧪 Example 2: Order Edit After Payment
A user orders a phone for ₹1000 and pays.

Then they modify the order using Burp Suite to change it to a ₹10,000 phone — after payment.

❌ Developer Assumption:
"If payment is done, user won’t change the order."

🔚 Result: User gets a more expensive product without paying extra.
