âœ… What Should Pentesters Do?
While testing for this vulnerability:

Remove parameters one at a time using Burp Suite (from URL, POST, headers, cookies).

Remove the value only (e.g. amount=), then

Remove the whole parameter (e.g. delete amount= completely).

Observe how the app behaves:

Does it throw an error?

Does it default to a weird value?

Does it skip something important?
