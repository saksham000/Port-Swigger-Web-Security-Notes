🔍 What are Business Logic Vulnerabilities?
Definition:
These are bugs or weaknesses in how an app is designed to work. They allow hackers to misuse features in ways developers didn’t expect.

Example:
Imagine an e-commerce website where you buy items by adding them to a cart and clicking "Pay ₹500".
But what if a hacker removes the payment step and goes straight to "Order Confirmed"? If the server doesn’t properly check whether payment was made, the hacker gets the product for free. That’s a logic flaw.

💡 Why Do These Happen?
They happen because:

Developers assume users will behave normally (e.g., only using buttons on the site).

They forget users can tamper with requests using tools like Burp Suite.

Different parts of the app are built by different people who may not understand the whole system.

Example:
A site might use JavaScript to check if you filled out all the fields in a form, but forget to do the same check on the server. A hacker can just skip those checks.

🎯 What Can Attackers Do With Them?
Depends on where the bug is. For example:

Skip payments and get items for free.

Bypass login and get admin access.

Modify their account balance.

Place illogical orders (like negative quantity or ₹0 price).

Even if the flaw doesn’t give the hacker something directly, it can still hurt the business.

🛠️ Examples of Business Logic Flaws
Ordering free stuff by changing the price to ₹0 in the request.

Reusing a coupon multiple times when it was meant for one-time use.

Bypassing limits, like changing the quantity from 1 to 1000 for a flash sale item.

Skipping steps, like confirming an order without paying.

🔐 Why Are These Bugs Dangerous?
They are hard to find automatically. Tools like scanners may miss them.

You need human thinking to understand how a real attacker could abuse features.

That’s why these are a hot target for bug bounty hunters.

✅ How to Prevent Them
Don’t trust the frontend (browser). Always validate things on the server-side.

Think like a hacker: “What happens if someone skips or changes this step?”

Test how parts of the app can be misused together.

Keep documentation and assumptions clear between dev teams.
