üö® What is OAST?
OAST = Out-Of-Band Application Security Testing

It means: instead of checking the server‚Äôs response, you watch for something the server does in the background, like making a DNS or HTTP request to your server.

üì¶ How OAST Works in SQLi
If you can make the database send a DNS or HTTP request to your own server, you know your injection worked. This is perfect for blind SQLi, where nothing visible happens in the page.

‚úÖ Requirements:
You need an external listener ‚Äî a server that waits for DNS/HTTP requests.
You can use:

Burp Collaborator (built into Burp Suite Pro)

requestbin, dnslog.cn, or your own public server

‚úÖ What is OAST (Out-of-Band Application Security Testing)?
OAST is a trick to detect SQL injection by forcing the database to make a network request to a server you control (like a DNS lookup or HTTP call).

Think of it like this:
You can't see the SQLi result on the page...
So instead, you say:
üëâ ‚ÄúHey DB, call my phone number (server) if my injection works!‚Äù

And if you get that call (= network request), it means your SQLi worked.

üß∞ What Do You Need?
You need a listener ‚Äî a server that can watch for network requests.

üõ† Use Burp Collaborator:

Built into Burp Suite Professional

Lets you generate a unique subdomain

Tells you if the server makes DNS/HTTP calls to that domain
