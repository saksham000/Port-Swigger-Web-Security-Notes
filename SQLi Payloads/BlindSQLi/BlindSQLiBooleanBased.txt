💡 What is Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection?
It’s a type of SQL injection where:

You don’t see any error messages.

You don’t see the actual query result.

But the application behavior changes based on whether your injected condition is TRUE or FALSE.

So, you use this behavior to guess things like:

Is the username "administrator"?

What’s the first letter of the password?

Etc.

🔍 Real World Analogy
Imagine you're blindfolded, but someone gives you a thumbs-up 👍 if your guess is right and thumbs-down 👎 if it's wrong. You can still figure things out by observing the reaction.
